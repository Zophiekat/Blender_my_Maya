# Blender_my_Maya
An Open Source project for creating Pyside6 based widget interfaces and tools for making Maya feel and behave like Blender

## PySide2 Viewport Example

The `pyside2_viewport_app.py` script demonstrates how to create a simple
PySide2 based window that embeds a Maya 3D viewport. To launch the window
within Maya, run the following in the Script Editor:

```python
import pyside2_viewport_app
pyside2_viewport_app.show()
```
